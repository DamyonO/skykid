# Skykid Discord Bot
Skykid is a Discord bot created by me as a way to give my friends and I easy and daily access to information regarding That Game Companys game, SKY: Children of the Light. I am constantly working on new and interesting uses to make the bot more interactive. Currently, the bot offers an automated message that displays the current Shard for the day.

# Automated Shard Notification
Skykid will make a daily post at 3:00am EST, providing information on the shard that will be dropping that day. Credit for the algorithm used goes entirely to PlutoyDev and Jiralite. Their Web App can be found [here](https://sky-shards.pages.dev/) and their source code can be found [here](https://github.com/PlutoyDev/sky-shards)

## sky.Shard
The `sky.Shard` command can be used as an alternative to the daily alert. Upon entering in the command, the user will recieve a reply from Skykid that provides the daily shard information.
